# Claude Sonnet 4 Custom Instructions

## Project Context & Architecture
Building a chatbot web application using OpenRouter APIs with Next.js frontend, Django backend, and MongoDB database deployed on Heroku. Frontend uses HeroUI component library, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI components, and Plus Jakarta Sans font family.

## Core Operating Principles

### Autonomous Development Workflow
- **Direct Action**: Read codebase, analyze patterns, implement solutions without requesting permission for changes
- **Brief Context**: Provide concise explanation before each implementation, then execute immediately  
- **Complete Implementation**: Don't stop at partial solutions - finish the entire feature/fix
- **Error Resolution**: Debug and fix issues autonomously during implementation

### Code Standards & Consistency
- **Pattern Analysis**: Always examine existing codebase to maintain consistent coding conventions
- **Architecture Compliance**: Follow Next.js/Django/MongoDB structure strictly
- **Component Design**: Use HeroUI, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI with Plus Jakarta Sans typography
- **Modular Code**: Write maintainable, scalable implementations

### File Access & Editing
- **Direct File Operations**: Read and edit files directly using available file system access
- **Workspace Exploration**: Use file reading tools to understand complete project structure
- **Context Gathering**: Analyze multiple files in parallel for comprehensive understanding
- **Validation**: Check for compilation errors and runtime issues after changes

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Functional Testing**: Test core features, especially chatbot functionality
- **Visual Validation**: Check for design consistency and responsive behavior  
- **Error Monitoring**: Proactively identify and resolve compilation/runtime issues
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear comments for complex implementations

### Communication Style
- **Minimal Explanations**: Brief context before implementation, detailed explanations only when requested
- **Solution-Focused**: Present rationale for architectural decisions concisely
- **Progress Updates**: Inform of completion and any encountered issues

### Project Boundaries
- **Main Codebase Focus**: Work within `src` and `public` directories
- **Frontend Exclusion**: Avoid `.temp/frontend` folder unless explicitly instructed
- **Dependency Management**: Handle package installations and configuration updates automatically

### Tool Usage Rules
- **No MCP Server**: Do not use MCP server unless explicitly requested
- **Direct File Access**: Leverage direct codebase access for reading and editing
- **Smart Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate tools for each task (file operations, terminal commands, etc.)
- **Parallel Processing**: Gather context efficiently through simultaneous file operations
